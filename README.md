It means a lot to us and helps us grow this open source library.

## We need your help

We believe CTRF can save **a lot** of time for engineers, a single data serialisation report, well structured, community driven and works with any framework. For over 30s years software engineers have used a de facto data serialisation report, you know the one! But we feel it‚Äôs time to modernise.

The only way we can grow CTRF is with your help and the support of the software engineering community.

## How can you help?

## Features

- **Send Test Results to Slack**: Automatically send test results to a Slack channel.
- **Send Flaky Test Details to Slack**: Automatically send flaky test details to a Slack channel.
- **Conditional Notifications**: Use the `--onFailOnly` option to send notifications only if tests fail.

## Setup

You'll need a CTRF report generated by your testing framework. [CTRF reporters](https://www.ctrf.io/docs/category/reporters) are available for most testing frameworks and easy to install.

### Create a Slack Incoming Webhook

1. Go to the [Slack API: Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) page.
2. Click on "Create a Slack App" or use an existing app.
3. Add the "Incoming Webhooks" feature to your app.
4. Activate the Incoming Webhook and add a new webhook to your workspace.
5. Copy the webhook URL provided.

### Set the Environment Variable

Set the webhook URL as an environment variable in your shell or CI environment:

```sh
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL='https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url'
```

Make sure to replace `'https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url'` with your actual webhook URL.

You might want to store the webhook URL as a secret.

## Usage

To send the test results summary to Slack:

```sh
npx slack-ctrf results /path/to/ctrf-report.json
```

To send flaky test report to Slack:

```sh
npx slack-ctrf flaky /path/to/ctrf-report.json
```

### Send Only on Failures

To send the test results summary to Slack only if there are failed tests, use the `--onFailOnly` option:

```sh
npx slack-ctrf results /path/to/ctrf-file.json --onFailOnly
```

or using the alias:

```sh
npx slack-ctrf results /path/to/ctrf-file.json -f
```

## Options

- `--onFailOnly, -f`: Send notification only if there are failed tests.

## What is CTRF?

CTRF is a universal JSON test report schema that addresses the lack of a standardized format for JSON test reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.
